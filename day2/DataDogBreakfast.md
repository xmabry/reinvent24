# Breakfast with the CISOs from Datadog and AWS

The ideas were are making sure that the data about systems was available to the engineers so that they can own the security of their systems. Education was a foundational topic that the AWS CISO shared. Hands on experience is something that is important with the tooling that's at their finger tips. Want to provide a space for seeing what a security event may look like before encountering it in the real world so they are better prepared and not just using theoretical information.

The AWS CISO mentioned there's a responsiblilty to make sure that security is built in to the way that engineering teams are doing. This is a challenge that I've seen.

## What's the biggest risk that we see with companies that move to the cloud and how to they mitigate this risk?

Risk 1: Inherent lack of knowledge
One team may be the most modern, but it doesn't perculate through the entire organizations especially security until late in the game. We find that we are trying to make sure that security is early in the adoption of cloud and that standards get created with security included.

Perpetual curiousity must prevail because leaders must be able to effectively lead and know the language. Can't sit on the side lines with technical information.

## Training in a tight budget environment
- Create a collection of free trainings and create a budget for the cloud resources that a person can use for their trainings that they find.
- Even in tight budgets you can still send 1-2 people who will then be responsible for bringing the knowledge back to the company and sharing it with the broader audience. They are going to become leaders but also provide them with practice they need to become leaders in the organization.
- Using the Well Architected framework as a means to help train folks whoare 

## Decentralizing increases team complexity, has that changed the way shared responsibility is done across an organization?
having a common platform has been a unifying thing. There's the ability to use that to create some accountabilty across the organization. At datadog combined their SRE and security teams to remove the silos between those two organizations. There's an improvement in the incident response, this is something that helped create knowledge transfer. Shared quality data is helpful into makeing sure that engineering and security are on the same page and can follow the same processes to complete a task.

## Incident response is harder in distributed cloud environments
There's a cultural element that takes the small issues and resolving them locally so they don't become bigger ones

## How do you write dectections in the cloud?
Datadog provides some rules out of the box that you can use to start doing the detections, but developing some of the tactics as detections as code. 

Create an environnent where there's a red team that creates something that the blue team has to go find so they can create alerting to detect what was done. Red teams should not be doing the same tactics techniques and procedures. Security Chaos testing


## Advice
- Subscribe to Datadogs news letter
- Don't operate in a silo
- Feel the pain of the people you're trying to work with
- Security should be telling people what they can do instead of what they can't do.
- Keep score and track making security simple
