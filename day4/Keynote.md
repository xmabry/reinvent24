## Make evolution a requirement for your systems and plan for it

Developing large distributed systems you accumulate complexity. But at someooint you have to acknowledge the complex.

Successful teams are scared of possibly doing thing wrong. Trying to improve and always asking questions that challenge the status quo

**IDEA: Durability threat model - write down the durability risks that may happen and find out ways to mitigate. Use leads to be durability reviewers.** 

## Focus on Ownership
- Build agency by let the teams feel like they have the support to deliver
- Not telling them how to do things and trust the team to
- Then keep you foot on the gas and help problem solve with urgency


## Break things down
Breaking big tasks down so that it reduces the scope of impact if you were to change it.

Investing in sustainability up front by decomposing the system into cells or parts that are fully testable standalone and also plays a role in a complex system.

## Minimize unpredictability
Create predictability so making sure that the system you create is consistent and behaves as one expects.

So that we're pushing to a static place and the downstream system pulls from thr static place over time. Also enables a concept of rollbacks as well.
Reduce impact of uncertainty and be disciplined in how you use automation.

## Automate complexity
Instead of asking what can we automate, we should ask "What shouldnt be automated".

Only don't automate tasks where humans absolutely need to be in the loop to review or make the higher level decision. Everything else should be automated. In this part of the task the speaker highlighted the impact of serverless Bedrock agents and leveraging AI to do some automation
